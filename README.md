> Thinking deep, having fun(with data!)

An app for generation, submission and display of deep philosophy quotes.
Also...nerd jokes.

## Installing / Getting started

-To start locally:

-Make sure node and npm are installed.

-Run 'npm install'.

-In server directory, run 'npm run dev' in terminal. This will spin up the server.

## Developing

If you want to work on or with the code of Deep Thoughts, I suggest you clone from git and work in your favorite editor as the easiest route to do so.

## Features

What's all the bells and whistles this project can perform?

- Philosophy quote storage and generation.
- Allows for user submitted quotes and a 'Discourse' field where users can leave an impermanent message, erased by the next submission to the field.
- Look for all the fun jokes and references, google the stuff that seems weird, it probably is some weird philosophy joke!

## Contributing

branch. Pull requests are warmly welcome, as are suggestions for future quotes or csvs to import into the database of your favorites! Get thoughtful, get weird.
